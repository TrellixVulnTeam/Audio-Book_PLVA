# Audio-Book
This project is purely made by using python. In this project , we are actually making a virtual asistent which is telling us, what is written in whole pdf.By using this , we dont have to read the books or pdf , we have to just listen it.we have used the pyPDF2 for reading pdfs and pyttsx3 for converting text to speech conversion.
